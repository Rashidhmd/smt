# 01.1
# Check if the following system of equations has a solution for x and y Real numbers:
#
#   x + y + 10 = 3
#   8 = y - x


# 01.2 
# Check if the previous system has a solution for x and y Integer numbers


# 01.3
# Check if the previous system of equations has a solution if we add the following inequality,
# both for the case in which x and y Real, and in the case in which they are Integers:
#
#   x > y


# 01.4
# Check if there exists Boolean values b1, b2, b3 such that:
#   (b1 OR b2) AND ((NOT b2) OR b3)


# 01.5
# Check if the following formula is satisfiable:
#
#       ((b AND x > 10) OR (x > 3 AND y > 4)) 
#   AND ((x + y)**2 == 20)
#   AND (NOT(b) OR y > 10)
#   
# where x and y are Real variables and b is a Boolean variable.


# 01.6
# Same as 01.5 but switch the last occurrence of "NOT(b)" with "b"


# 01.7
# Prove that NOT(p AND q) implies (NOT p) OR (NOT q)


# 01.8
# Prove that NOT(p AND q) *does not* imply (NOT p) AND (NOT q)
